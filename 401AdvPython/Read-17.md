* Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not.

*  They are used at the server side to validate the format of email addresses or passwords during registration, used for parsing text data files to find, replace, or delete certain string, etc. They help in manipulating textual data, which is often a prerequisite for data science projects involving text mining.

* some very useful functions provided by the re library, such as: compile(), search(), findall(), sub() for search and replace, split().

* In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. **import re**

* The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None.

* the search function, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.

* The group function returns the string matched by the re.
