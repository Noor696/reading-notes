### Discussion Questions:
**1. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

Here are the steps to solve problem:

1. Understand 
you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it . 

2. Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

3. Divide
Divide the problem into small solving steps, starting with the simplest and then the most complex, so that you can solve the original problem

**4. Stuck?**
here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

**a. Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).**

**b. Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?**
“Sometimes we get so lost in the details of a problem that we overlook general principles that would solve the problem at a more general level, Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.

**c. Research: can you research about problem on "google" someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).**

5. Practice
6. Conclusion

**2. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

**I have a statement I believe in:**
**_Work, learn and make an effort with more time than your salary, so that one day you will work with less time and with a higher salary_**
