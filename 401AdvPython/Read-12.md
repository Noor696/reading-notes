## Read 12 - Stack and Queue

**Stacks and Queues**

[Stacks and Queues](https://everythingcomputerscience.com/discrete_mathematics/Stacks_and_Queues.html)

* Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.

* Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.

* In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: 

    - push the item into the stack

    - pop the item out of the stack

*  In the queue only two operations are allowed:

    - Enqueue: means to insert an item into the back of the queue.

    - Dequeue: means removing the front item.

* The difference between stacks and queues is in removing:

    - In a stack we remove the item the most recently added

    - In a queue we remove the item the least recently added.

* FIFO & LILO and LIFO & FILO Principles:

    - Queue: First In First Out (FIFO): The first object into a queue is the first object to leave the queue, used by a queue.

    - Stack: Last In First Out (LIFO): The last object into a stack is the first object to leave the stack, used by a stack

    - Stack: First In Last Out (FILO): The first object or item in a stack is the last object or item to leave the stack.

    - Stack: First In Last Out (FILO): The first object or item in a stack is the last object or item to leave the stack.




**Stack Data Structure**

[Stack Data Structure](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/stack)

* You can think of the stack data structure as the pile of plates on top of another.

* Basic Operations of Stack:

   - Push: Add an element to the top of a stack

   - Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack

   - IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty

   - IsFull: Check if the stack is full
   
   - Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it
