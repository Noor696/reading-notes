* Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is.

* There are several authentication types. For purposes of user identity. 

* Authentication enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users or processes to gain access to their protected resources.

* During authentication, credentials provided by the user are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' information either on the local operating system server or through an authentication server.

* User and process authentication are used to ensure that only authorized individuals or processes are allowed to access company IT resources. Depending on the use cases for which authentication is used, authentication can consist of either SFA, 2FA or MFA.

* **Authentication vs. authorization**
  - **Authorization** includes the process through which an administrator grants rights to authenticated users, as well as the process of checking user account permissions to verify that the user has been granted access to those resources. The privileges and preferences granted for an authorized account depend on the user's permissions, which are either stored locally or on an authentication server. The settings defined for all these environment variables are established by an administrator.
