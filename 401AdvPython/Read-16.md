* The Caesar Cipher is a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking, thanks to its simplicity

* The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.

* To make the encrypted message, I shifted the alphabet by 6, Decrypting a message, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount.

* That enemy does not know that Caesar always uses a shift of 3, so he must attempt to "crack" the cipher without knowing the shift.
There are three main techniques he could use: 
   - frequency analysis, 
   - known plaintext, 
   - brute force.

* the three key aspects of data encryption:
   - Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
   - Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
   - Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.




### Caesar cipher
[Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

* Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

* The Caesar cipher can be easily broken even in a ciphertext-only scenario. Two situations can be considered:

   - an attacker knows (or guesses) that some sort of simple substitution cipher has been used, but not specifically that it is a Caesar scheme.
   - an attacker knows that a Caesar cipher is in use, but does not know the shift value.
