### What Is SSH: Understanding Encryption, Ports and Connection

* Secure Shell Protocol, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to access, control, and modify their remote servers over the internet.

* SSH provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.

* Encryption Techniques:

 - Symmetric Encryption :  form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host. Effectively, anyone possessing the key can decrypt the message being transferred.

 - Asymmetric Encryption : uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key. Together, both these keys form a public-private key pair.

 - Hashing : One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections.
