[Component Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

* **Component-based architecture** focuses on divides the problem into sub-problems

* The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure **component reusability**.

* Component-oriented software design has many advantages such as :

  1. Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.

  2. Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

* **A component** is 

  1. a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

  2. a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

  3. A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.
