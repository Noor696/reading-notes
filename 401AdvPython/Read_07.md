## Data Analysis

### What is Jupyter Lab

[What is Jupyter Lab - Overview](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

* JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.
* JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. For a demonstration of JupyterLab and its features.
* You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing.
   - Code Consoles
   - Kernel-backed documents
   - Notebook cell 
   - Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers

* JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.).

* upyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab, including new themes

* JupyterLab is served from the same server and uses the same notebook document format as the classic Jupyter Notebook.


### NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

[NumPy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

* NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package.

* Almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in some way.

* the top four benefits that NumPy can bring to your code:
  - More speed
  - Fewer loops
  - Clearer code
  - Better quality
